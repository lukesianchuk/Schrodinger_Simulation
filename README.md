# Schrodinger_Simulation

This project, authored by Maria Preciado, Nick Dal Farra, and Luke Sianchuk, aims to simulate the 1D Schrodinger equation using the the Leapfrog, Crank-Nicolson, and RK4 finite difference schemes.
Each of the three numerical solvers have been applied to the Harmonic Oscillator, Infinite Square Well, and Quantum Tunneling problems.
The CN method proved most robust in the conservation of physical quantities, the Leapfrog method was most efficient, and the RK4 was most accurate.
